# Weekle Budget App

You can see the project here: https://weekly-budget-application.netlify.app



With this app you can set your weekly budget. You can then list different types of expenses and their values to end up seeing the total amount of your expenses and their value in different colors.

The idea is to quantify how far or close you are to your budget. To manage your personal finances.
